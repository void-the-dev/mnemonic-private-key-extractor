# Extract private keys for a seed phrase with an optional passphrase

If you are stuck with an sparrow wallet that had a 24-word seed phrase or a passphrase and cannot migrate to an ordinal-supported wallet, this is for you.

You can also use this to share access to only one account of your wallet.

## How to use

You can use the public website [here](https://mnemonic-private-key-extractor.vercel.app/)

You can also run this locally to verify the code or do offline.

## Getting Started locally / offline

You can run this locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
